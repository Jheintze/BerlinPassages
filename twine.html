    <h1>What is Twine?</h1>
    <h3>"Twine is an open-source tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories."</h3>
    <p>the definition given on <a href="https://twinery.org/">Twine's Website</a> </p> 
    <br> 
    <p>Twine is a dynamic tool used for gaming, writing, and even academia. Without needing to code, you can craft intricate stories with variables, conditional logic, images, CSS, and JavaScript.  Twine stories are directly published to HTML making it easy to share. </p>
    <p>Given its focus on text-based gameplay, Twine games are often considered electronic literature or interactive fiction.</p>
